See My Trip is a website that aims to inspire would-be roadtrippers or holiday tourers. Users can register as Voyagers by creating a profile, allowing them to post a planned trip giving details of when and where they'll be going and their mode of transport. Other users can follow the trip and comment - either to give recommendations for stops or just to show their enthusiasm.

Voyagers can post trip journal updates, which appear linked to the relevant trip and allow other site users to see how their trip is going. The live link is here: [See My Trip](https://seemytripcapstone-0e4622862850.herokuapp.com/).

# UX Design

## Font
The [Cabin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cabin) font was chosen for this site, both as a close approximation to the Transport font used on UK road signs and because it is an easily legible, user-friendly font.
